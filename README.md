## ESP8266 Lux sensort to MQTT

This is an Arduino sketch for an ESP8266 with a [DFRobot Lux Sensor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/ambient-light-sensor-0-200klx) that reports a value per minute to an MQTT broker. I'm using this to feed Lux data into [Openhab](https://www.openhab.org/) to drive some rules for turning lights on and off.
